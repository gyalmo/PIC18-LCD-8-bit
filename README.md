# PIC18-LCD-8-bit:
this is a PIC18 program to interface LCD , on 8-bit mode 

- PIC microcontrolers are programmed by embedded C language .
- In this program we are going to print a message on LCD on 8 bit mode.

# Embedded C :

Here are some objectives about embedded C programming :
- In nature, It is cross-development
- I	It is hardware dependent
- Used for limited resources like RAM and ROM

The embedded C program has a structure similar to C programming.The five layers are:
- Comments

Comments written in code to make it more understandable to the reader. Usually comments are written in // or /* */.

- Pre-processor directives

This tells the compiler which files to look in to find the symbols that are not present in the program.

- Global declaration

Global declaration part of the code is the part where the global variables are declared and the user-defined functions are declared in this part of the code also, they can be accessed from anywhere.

- Local declaration

- Main function()
