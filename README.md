# PIC18-LCD-8-bit:
this is a PIC18 program to interface LCD , on 8-bit mode 

- PIC microcontrolers are programmed by embedded C language .
- In this program we are going to print a message on LCD on 8 bit mode.

# Embedded C :

Here are some objectives about embedded C programming :
- In nature, It is cross-development
- I	It is hardware dependent
- Used for limited resources like RAM and ROM

The embedded C program has a structure similar to C programming.The five layers are:
- Comments

Comments written in code to make it more understandable to the reader. Usually comments are written in // or /* */.

- Pre-processor directives

This tells the compiler which files to look in to find the symbols that are not present in the program.

- Global declaration

Global declaration part of the code is the part where the global variables are declared and the user-defined functions are declared in this part of the code also, they can be accessed from anywhere.

- Local declaration

These variables are declared in the respective functions and cannot be used outside the main function.

- Main function()

As every C programs need to have the main function. So does an embedded C program has .Each main function contains 2 parts i.e. a declaration part and an execution part. The declaration part is the part where we declare all the variables and the execution part begins with the curly brackets and ends with the curly close bracket. Both the declaration and execution part are inside the curly braces.
